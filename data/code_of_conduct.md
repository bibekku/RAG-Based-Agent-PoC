# NebulaForge Code of Conduct

At NebulaForge, we believe in building not only transformative technology but also a culture rooted in integrity, accountability, and mutual respect. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for everyone involved in our organization—employees, contractors, interns, and open-source contributors.

---

## 1. Respectful Communication

Every member of the NebulaForge team is expected to foster an environment of respectful, inclusive communication. We work across time zones, disciplines, and cultures—therefore, tone and clarity matter.

If you're disagreeing in a code review, focus on the issue, not the person. For example, saying, "This approach may not scale well due to X," is constructive. Saying, "This is a dumb way to do it," is not. Intent does not outweigh impact—when in doubt, err on the side of kindness.

---

## 2. Inclusive Collaboration

We are committed to inclusion across gender, race, disability, age, religion, and identity. Collaboration means making space for all voices, especially those historically underrepresented in tech.

If someone’s being talked over during a design meeting, call it out: “Let’s pause and let Priya finish her point.” If you’re unsure how someone wants to be addressed, ask respectfully. Misgendering someone after being corrected is not acceptable.

---

## 3. Anti-Harassment Policy

Harassment in any form is unacceptable. This includes but is not limited to: unwelcome sexual attention, offensive jokes, intimidation, or persistent disruption of communication channels.

Scenario: During a virtual happy hour, someone uses a background with suggestive imagery. A colleague expresses discomfort, but the person laughs it off. In this case, the conduct is unacceptable, even if it wasn’t intended as harassment. We expect swift apologies and adjustments.

All team communication tools—including Slack, GitHub comments, and Zoom chats—are considered extensions of the workplace.

---

## 4. Handling Conflicts

Conflicts are natural in any high-performance environment, but they must be addressed professionally.

If you're in a disagreement about project direction, escalate through the proper channels. Passive-aggressive comments or bypassing a peer to win favor with management will not be tolerated.

We recommend the “3x3” method: if a conflict persists after 3 back-and-forths in chat, take it to a 30-minute face-to-face call.

---

## 5. Open Source & External Contributions

Many of us contribute to open source, either as part of our job or on our own time. When representing NebulaForge, you must adhere to these principles:

- Be transparent about affiliations. Don’t submit PRs to competitor projects without disclosing your role at NebulaForge.
- Avoid disparaging competing technologies in public forums. Technical comparisons are fine; ad hominem is not.
- Do not reuse internal, unpublished code in external projects—even in anonymized form—without legal review.

Scenario: An engineer publishes a CLI tool using patterns they developed for an internal NebulaForge system. Even if the code is rewritten from scratch, it may still be considered derivative and subject to IP review.

---

## 6. Confidentiality & NDAs

Much of our work at NebulaForge is under NDA—whether it's for our clients, partners, or internal R&D. Disclosing sensitive information, even unintentionally, can result in legal consequences.

Scenario: You’re speaking at a conference and reference "a recent scalability win with a major e-commerce client." If that client relationship isn't public, you've likely violated NDA, even if no specifics were named.

When in doubt, ask Legal or the Comms team before speaking or publishing externally.

---

## 7. Use of AI & Generative Tools

We encourage responsible use of AI and LLMs in our workflows, but with caution:

- Never input proprietary data or unreleased code into public LLMs like ChatGPT.
- Use locally hosted LLMs for sensitive tasks when possible.
- Generated output should always be reviewed by a human before publication.

Scenario: A developer uses a public AI to help refactor a piece of code under NDA and pastes the entire function into the prompt. This violates both our NDA policy and our AI usage guidelines.

---

## 8. Social Media & Public Commentary

You are a reflection of NebulaForge, especially if your profile lists us as your employer. We encourage personal expression, but ask that you:

- Avoid engaging in public arguments that could be seen as brand-damaging.
- Never leak internal frustrations or announce confidential information before official channels do.

Scenario: A designer tweets about being "sick of working on Feature Z that keeps getting canceled." Even if vague, this can be interpreted as insider info or reflect poorly on the product team.

---

## 9. Reporting Concerns

If you witness or experience a violation of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to report it promptly. You can use our anonymous reporting form, speak with your team lead, or contact HR directly.

Retaliation for reporting concerns is strictly prohibited. We commit to following up discreetly and appropriately.

---

## 10. Enforcement & Consequences

Violations of this Code will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Outcomes may range from a verbal warning to termination, depending on severity and context.

We believe in accountability, not punishment. Most issues can be resolved through respectful dialogue and a willingness to improve. However, repeated or egregious behavior will not be tolerated.

---

At NebulaForge, our culture is one of excellence—and that starts with how we treat each other. Let’s build something extraordinary, together.
